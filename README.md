# Ruby and Rails Learning Plan

This learning plan is designed for someone new to both Ruby and Rails.

It'll start you off on the Ruby path and then introduce Rails.

I recommend you have a good fundamental understanding of Ruby before learning Rails.

This document was created by Sean Lerner.

Some of the recommended books are available for free on the web. Others can be purchased or accessed through [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com).

#### O'Reilly Books for free or on the cheap

The O'Reilly monthly plan is a little expensive, but there are ways to access it for free or on the cheap:

- Your local library may offer access to free. For example, the [Toronto Public Library system does](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDMEDB0099&R=EDB0099).

- You can purchase an [ACM](https://acm.org/) annual membership which includes access to O'Reilly books.

- Your employer may already have a team membership or provide you a learning budget.

## Learn Ruby The Hard Way

First go through **Learn Ruby The Hard Way**:<br>
[https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)

## Exercism - Ruby Track

After you complete a few exercises from **Learn Ruby the Hard Way**, sign up to Exercism and register for the Ruby track:<br>
[https://exercism.io/my/tracks/ruby](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/ruby)

They have 'mentor' and 'non-mentor' modes: go with non-mentor mode (as with mentor mode, you won't be able to progress until a mentor reviews your submissions, which can take a while). Instead, if you get stuck, you can reach out to me for help.

### Continue in parallel:

- Learn Ruby the Hard Way
- Ruby Exercism track

## Command Line Crash Course

If you are new or uncomfortable working on the command line, do this quick Command Line Crash Course:<br>

## Eloquent Ruby

After you've completed **Learn Ruby The Hard Way** go through **Eloquent Ruby**:<br>
[http://eloquentruby.com/](http://eloquentruby.com/)

The chapters are small and easily digestible.

### Continue in parallel:

# Going Further

If you'd like to dive deeper on some of the above topics, try thoughtbot's Upcase learning trails:

## Editor

There are many popular editors. Knowing your editor well is key to levelling up as a developer. At the time of this writing, popular editors include Sublime, Atom, VS Code, Vim, Emacs, and RubyMine. There's too many editors to provide good suggestions on where to look to learn your editor of choice better, so I recommend you seek this material out yourself.

*(however, the author of this document uses [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com), and he recommends you try [https://sublimetextbook.com/](https://sublimetextbook.com/) if you choose to go with sublime)*
